# VS Code Toggle Theme Extension

This extension adds a status bar item to quickly toggle between light and dark themes.

## How it works

Clicking on the `ðŸŒ“ï¸Ž` icon in the status bar triggers the command `workbench.action.toggleLightDarkThemes`
that was added in VS Code [1.69](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_69#_toggle-between-light-and-dark-themes).

## Attribution
